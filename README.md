# README: GANs & Diffusion Models

## StyleGAN2 & StyleGAN3

Emphasizing the **W latent space**, StyleGAN2 & 3 convert an image into a **512-dimensional latent vector**. Image inversion allows the transformation of real images into this latent space, enabling edits and fine-tuning. The models showcase high-quality image synthesis, but also exhibit challenges in **maintaining fine details and global coherence**.

### Results & Observations
- StyleGAN2 & 3 can achieve **remarkably high-resolution images**, but they struggle with **global consistency in complex scenes**.
- **Inversion techniques** attempt to project real images into latent space, but may **lose fine details or distort features**.

| Image | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Image A](https://github.com/robilovric/DeepFakeGen/blob/main/stylegan2/results/seed0042.png) | Image A demonstrates the abstract backgrounds usually associated with a GAN-generated image. |
| ![Image B](https://github.com/robilovric/DeepFakeGen/blob/main/stylegan3/results/seed6399.png) | Image B exhibits heavy distortion issues. GANs sometimes have problems with symmetry, particularly earrings. |
| ![Image C](https://github.com/robilovric/DeepFakeGen/blob/main/stylegan3/results/seed6402.png) | Image C contains an abstract exhibits issues that earrings often present for GANs. |
| ![Image D](https://github.com/robilovric/DeepFakeGen/blob/main/stylegan3/results/seed6401.png) | Image D also contains a highly distorted secondary image and other distorted details. |

## StyleCLIP: Text-Guided GAN Editing

StyleCLIP enables **text-based modifications** of GAN-generated images. It bridges **GANs and CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)**, leveraging natural language descriptions to steer image synthesis. This effectively introduces **text-to-image capabilities** within the GAN framework.

## Stable Diffusion: Robust Text-to-Image Generation

Stable Diffusion takes a **different approach**, using diffusion models for **prompt-driven image synthesis**. Unlike GANs, it iteratively refines **random noise into a coherent image**. It excels at **text-guided image generation**, producing diverse and high-quality outputs.

## GANs vs. Diffusion Models

| Feature | GANs | Diffusion Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Training Stability** | Requires careful tuning | More stable |
| **Image Quality** | High-resolution, but artifacts possible | High-quality and consistent |
| **Diversity** | Limited due to mode collapse | High diversity |
| **Editability** | Strong with latent vector manipulation | Less flexible but powerful |
| **Text-Guided Generation** | StyleCLIP enables text control | Natively supports text prompts |

## The Future: Hybrid GAN-Diffusion Approaches

Combining **GANs and diffusion models** could yield the best of both worlds. A hybrid approach could leverage **GANs' speed and efficiency** with **diffusion models' flexibility and quality**, leading to breakthroughs in **realistic and controllable image synthesis**.
